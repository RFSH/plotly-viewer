Analysis

Flow analysis - scatterplot Data from cytometers are usually analysed by examina
tion of graphs. Regions on the graphs correspond to cell populations. By dissect
ing cell populations, their parameters such as number of cells, average cell siz
e and protein abundance can be assessed.

Flow cytometry data are presented on either histograms (one parameter graph) or 
scatterplots (two parameters). If more than two parameters are analysed, then co
mbination of several plots is used.

Regions drawn on plots to dissect cell populations are called gates. There are m
any types of gates and in a single experiment usually a combination of gates is 
used to define population of interest. The overall analysis can become very comp
lex when more than two or three fluorescent colours are analysed.

Due to this complexity and to subjectivity of drawing the gates there is conside
rable effort made to propose some advanced analytical methods for flow cytometry
 data.
